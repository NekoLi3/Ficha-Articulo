    <p>Introduction</p>
    <p> Companies adopting online transactions seek efficient and error-free payment processes.
        The integration of front-end and back-end systems, particularly through ERP (enterprise resource planning)
        payment systems, is crucial for seamless automated payment processing. ERP consolidates data from various
        sources into a unified system, and FinTech providers now offer ERP solutions with payment integration
        capabilities to enhance financial management.</p>

        purchasing experience. ERP vendors like Sage Intacct and Netsuite offer payment systems allowing integration
        with external solutions and web applications. However, further research and case studies are needed to evaluate
